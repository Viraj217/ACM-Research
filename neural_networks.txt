NEURAL NETWORKS also called as SIMULATED NN/ARTIFICIAL NN

NN tries to imitate the brain by finding patterns among various situations to process information and make 
calculated outcomes which is the foundation of DL.

Since they resemble the neurons in our brain they are referd as 'NEURAL'

These are nodes that resemble the neurons which cluster to identify patterns in data.


Application: This method has been used to handle difficult machine-learning issues including picture classification, 
recommendation engines, and language-to-language translation.
